    <pre style="font-size: 20px">
Beautiful is <b>better</b> than <b>ugly</b>.
Explicit is <i>better</i> than <i>implicit</i>.
Simple is <ins>better</ins> than <ins>complex</ins>.
Complex is <strong>better</strong> than <strong>complicated</strong>.
Flat is <em>better</em> than <em>nested</em>.
Sparse is <mark style="background-color: red;">better</mark> than <mark style="background-color: red;">dense</mark>
Readability <del>counts</del>.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although <sub>practicality</sub> beats <sub>purity</sub>.
Errors should never pass <sup>silently</sup>.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
